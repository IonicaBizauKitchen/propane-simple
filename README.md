==============

Propane-Simple is a work in progress style update for the 37Signals
[Campfireâ„¢](http://campfirenow.com/) chat mac client
[PropaneApp](http://propaneapp.com).

To update your theme replace <code>/styles</code> and <code>/unsupported</code>
directories in <code>~/Library/Application\ Support/Propane/</code> directory
with those in this repo. Be sure to backup your original copies or they will be
gone.

You can also run `rake install` which will create backups if you don't have them
(i.e. first run), and then copy the files over each time.

Note: I use [CodeKit](http://incident57.com/codekit/) to compile the
sass/compass however many other apps will work just as fine.

Special thanks to [jonrohan](https://github.com/jonrohan) for his work on the
[caveatPatchor.js](https://github.com/jonrohan/organic-propane/blob/master/unsupported/caveatPatchor.js)
file.

##Propane Plus The <code>propaneplus</code> branch is developed for the GitHub's
custom version of PropaneApp. One of the many beautiful features you can play
with, as a GitHubber.
